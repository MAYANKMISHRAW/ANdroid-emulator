There are a lot of apps in smartphone which are
repetitive and are not required by a student. There is
a need to optimize these smartphones and apps in-
order to streamline the working of student and take
away excessive resources that are not required by
them such as dating apps. This proposed work uses
application based user interface for using services
that are the the basic necessity for a common student,
and
daily to daily need fulfilling apps that reduces the
burden of a student from desk work and let them
focus on their prime job ie. to gain knowledge. This
serves as a very handy and feasible resource for
students as well as common man as it provides ease
of accessing and updating information.
INTRO
The Project works with the making of a centralized
digital utility application for a student. Unique digital
IDs or passwords can be provided to a single entity. Th
ese apps will be independent from the other student
and can be used as a private property.
This project is an app which takes in the input by the users
as input, processes it-saves the password and then gives a
result according the input provided.
